Before calling for CR, CR yourself, you will save time and effort finding the problems yourself.

Don't make it personal, make a constrictive CR, explain your comments, don't refer to personal traits, don't judge, keep it professional and always remember, mistakes happen every day, the process is there to support you.

### Don't own code - Don't blame
